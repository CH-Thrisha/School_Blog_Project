# School_Blog_Project
Creating a school blog API with FastAPI and MongoDB using the Motor library for asynchronous database operations and Pydantic for data validation involves a few key steps. Hereâ€™s how to set up a basic API with CRUD operations for blog posts.

Running the Application:
Start the server with Uvicorn:

bash
uvicorn main:app --reload

The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000. You can test the following endpoints:

POST /blog/: Create a new blog post.
GET /blog/: Retrieve all blog posts.
GET /blog/{id}: Retrieve a blog post by ID.
PUT /blog/{id}: Update a blog post by ID.
DELETE /blog/{id}: Delete a blog post by ID.

Data Validation
With Pydantic, invalid data (like missing required fields or incorrect data types) will automatically result in a 422 Unprocessable Entity response. For example, trying to create a blog post without a title or content will be validated before it reaches the database, ensuring data consistency.
